# nginx pagespeed
This repo existed to build nginx & [the mod_pagespeed plugin](https://www.modpagespeed.com/doc/build_ngx_pagespeed_from_source) with the Fedora copr infrastructure.

The pagespeed project has [moved to the Apache Incubator](https://www.modpagespeed.com/doc/release_notes), and [ngx_pagespeed sounds unsupported](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pagespeed-mod/issues/2069).

I no longer use pagespeed, someone else is welcome to fork this, but for now it's going into read only mode.
